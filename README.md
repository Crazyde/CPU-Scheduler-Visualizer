## üìä How to Use the Tool

Once the application is running, you will see the main interface. Here is how to navigate:

1. **Select an Algorithm**: Use the dropdown menu to choose the scheduling algorithm you want to visualize.
2. **Input Data**: Enter the necessary process details, including arrival times and burst times.
3. **Start Simulation**: Click the "Run" button to begin the simulation.
4. **View Results**: Watch the Gantt chart fill in and see metrics displayed for each process.

## üìù Topics Covered

This tool covers various topics related to CPU scheduling. You can learn about:

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: The simplest scheduling method.
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Focuses on minimizing the waiting time.
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: Allows preemption to serve shorter processes first.
- **Round Robin**: Ensures fair CPU time distribution among processes.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Gives preference to more important processes.
